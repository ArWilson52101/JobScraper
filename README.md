# JobScraper
Final project for one of my classes. Runs in a python script to search (customizable) key words in job boards and adds them to a sqllite database for locally ran goodness. displays the jobs in a html page. 
It also allows you to save jobs to the top of the list. I'd like to make it prettier but it worked as a final project!

# How to use
visit the website (if you're just running it locally, it should just be localhost/filename/index.php)

open a cmd window and navigate to the file and run python -m job_scraper

refresh the website to add the jobs.

Browse through, save them with the drop down for various scenarios.
